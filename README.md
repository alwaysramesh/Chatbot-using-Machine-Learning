Chatbot using Machine Learning
📝 Project Description
This project is an AI-powered chatbot built using Python, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning techniques. It is designed to provide intelligent and interactive conversations using Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries like NLTK and SpaCy. The chatbot is trained on a .txt dataset to understand and generate human-like responses.

Additionally, the project aims to enhance the chatbot using Reinforcement Learning, allowing it to learn new responses dynamically when it encounters unknown queries. This makes it an adaptive and evolving chatbot, improving over time based on user interactions.

🚀 How It Works
Preprocessing – The dataset is cleaned, tokenized, and vectorized using NLP techniques.

Training the Model – A machine learning model is trained to understand patterns and generate appropriate responses.

User Interaction – The chatbot takes user input, processes it, and generates a relevant response.
